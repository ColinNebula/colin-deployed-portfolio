As an open and approachable person who loves to engage with others both in person and virtually, 
I find myself always drawn to anything to do with technology and computers. 
As a self starter who loves being part of a team as well, I bring discpline and rigour from my years serving the US Army. 
This, in addition to my numerous diplomas in digital art, technology, animation, 
and now coding, have helped me reach my present postion where I hope to develop websites, 
both large and small. Ease of transition, smooth and appealing visuals that help deliver a client's vision in a concise and timely manner are my goals. 
Thank you for visiting my portfolio.

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position



WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
