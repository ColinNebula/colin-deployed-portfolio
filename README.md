As an open and approachable person who loves to engage with others both in person and virtually, 
I find myself always drawn to anything to do with technology and computers. 
As a self starter who loves being part of a team as well, I bring discpline and rigour from my years serving the US Army. 
This, in addition to my numerous diplomas in digital art, technology, animation, 
and now coding, have helped me reach my present postion where I hope to develop websites, 
both large and small. Ease of transition, smooth and appealing visuals that help deliver a client's vision in a concise and timely manner are my goals. 
Thank you for visiting my portfolio.

AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards WHEN I view the source code

Right Click in your browser window to view the source code from inspect on firefox or windows Edge or use the google DevTools from settings more tools.

THEN I find semantic HTML elements article

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements The !DOCTYPE Declaration Head, body, main-content, footer

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css"

WHEN I view the image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes

img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" alt="search engine optimization

WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order div lu li a

WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
